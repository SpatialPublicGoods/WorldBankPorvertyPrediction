This paper presents an innovative approach to predicting household income one year in advance by integrating traditional household survey data with big data from administrative sources, weather data, and nightlight satellite imagery. Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning methods, we aim to overcome the limitations of conventional income prediction models that often rely solely on survey data. Our methodology combines granular, real-time data from diverse sources, providing a more comprehensive and dynamic understanding of the socioeconomic factors influencing household income. By incorporating weather patterns and nightlight data, we capture environmental and economic activity indicators that are crucial for accurate forecasting. This analysis not only enhances the precision of income predictions but also offers valuable insights for policy-making and economic planning. The outcome of this research is expected to be instrumental for governments and organizations in implementing targeted interventions.
